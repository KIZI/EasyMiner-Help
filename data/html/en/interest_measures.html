<p>Interest measures affect how the rules are mined. There are two measures by default, <a onclick="help.clickStep(2,6)">Confidence</a> and <a onclick="help.clickStep(2,7)">Support</a>. You can add two more, <a onclick="help.clickStep(2,8)">Lift</a> and ‘Rule length’ by clicking ‘Add interest measure’. You can edit each measure by clicking an edit icon next to it <img src="../_help/data/html/img/edit_icon.png"> .</p>
