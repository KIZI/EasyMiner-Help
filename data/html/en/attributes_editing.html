<p>An attribute cannot be edited after you create it. Create a new one if you need to. You can hide the attribute which you don't want to use by clicking a cross icon <img src="../_help/data/html/img/cross_icon.png"> next to it. If you want to bring back hidden attributes, click ‘show hidden’ on the bottom of the Attributes window.</p>
