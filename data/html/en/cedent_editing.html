<p>Each attribute has a set of three icons below which appear after you hover over it. The first one is ‘Negation’ <img src="../_help/data/html/img/negation_icon.png"> - it adds a ‘not’ before the attribute. The second is ‘Edit’ <img src="../_help/data/html/img/edit_icon.png"> which allows you to edit the value merging. The last one is an icon for ‘Remove’ <img src="../_help/data/html/img/cross_icon.png"> - it removes the attribute from antecedent or consequent.</p>
