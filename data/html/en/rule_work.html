First icon <img src="../_help/data/html/img/icon-ok-20.png"> adds the rule to the <a onclick="help.clickStep(4,4)">rule clipboard</a>. Second icon (thumbs up <img src="../_help/data/html/img/icon-thumb-up-20.png"> ) adds the rule to the <a onclick="help.clickStep(4,5)">knowledge base</a> as interesting and the third one (thumbs down <img src="../_help/data/html/img/icon-thumb-down-20.png"> ) as not interesting. The last icon displays rule details <img src="../_help/data/html/img/icon-info-20.png">.</p>
