<p>The knowledge base is a place where you store all relevant rules. You can add a rule to the knowledge base from <a onclick="help.clickStep(4,1)">discovered rules</a> or <a onclick="help.clickStep(4,4)">rule clipboard</a> by clicking a thumb up <img src="../_help/data/html/img/icon-thumb-up-20.png"> (or down <img src="../_help/data/html/img/icon-thumb-down-20.png">) icon. Thumb up will mark the rule as ‘interesting’, thumb down as ‘not interesting’.
